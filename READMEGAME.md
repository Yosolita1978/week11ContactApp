# Yes, another Game App

### Introduction

You already know how to build a little game in React. Let's do something similar, but know you can keep track of scores and view the leaderboard. 
Little fun fact: you build your game in week 5! Do you remember week 5?

### Overview
You would have to create a full-stack project following the template from past projects. 

In the front-end, your app could be any of these three games: 
* Your past react-game project (Feel free to use the same game) 
* Guess my number
* Tic Tac Toe

In the back-end, your scheme should provide routes/endpoints to:
* Create a new player
* Update a player's score
* Remove a player
* Fetch a list (leaderboard) of top players (ranked by score)

### Back-end:
You need to use Postgress and Express to connect your DB. Your DB should have a table "players" with at least this columns:
* player ID
* player name
* player score
### Front-End.
Make sure that you have inputs in your front-ent to grab the player name
When the user finishes the game, save the score in your DN
If the user selected it, show a list with the top 10 scores (ranked by score)

### Extra Features:
* When the user finishes the game, show them their last score and the new one 
* A test file to test your form component
