# Yes, another Weather App

### Introduction
You already have a front-end weather app. Let's reuse that connection with the OpenWeather API and create a simple app. 
Little fun fact: you build this in week 7! Do you remember week 7?

### Overview
You would have to create a full-stack project following the template from past projects. 
In the front-end, your app will display ONE day forecast for the user using the info collected from the OpenWeather API ï»¿https://openweathermap.org/api

## Backend:
You need to use Postgress and Express to connect your DB. Your DB should have a table "users" with at least this columns:
* Users ID
* User name
* Favorite City

## Front-End.
Make sure that when the user searches for a city, that value goes to two places:
* Your API call 
* If the user selected it, to your db as the favorite city for the user

### Features:
* Any button that allows the user to save a city as their favorite
* A db that store the favorite city of the user
* A view of one day of the location that the user is searching. 

### Extra Features:
* An Update button to update the favorite city from the user
* Ask the user for an email and register this camp in your DB too
* Error handling
  - Your form should use HTML input attributes to validate input and make entering data fast and easy
  - Show a user-visible error message to indicate what's wrong and how the user can fix it
* A test file to test your form component
